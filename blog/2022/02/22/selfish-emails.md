# Selfish emails

A disturbing trend is selfish emails. Emails are becoming alerts instead of containing the pertinent information. Ask: Put useful information back into emails. This includes attachments.

Example comes from Amazon. Here's Amazon shipping confirmation from 2012:

Now compare that with a more Amazon shipping confirmation (2021):
