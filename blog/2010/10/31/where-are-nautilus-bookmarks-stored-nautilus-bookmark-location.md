Nautilus bookmarks are stored in `~/.gtk-bookmarks`.

```
vim ~/.gtk-bookmarks
```

Nautilus uses uniform resource identifier (URI) syntax for bookmarks.

Special URIs include:

```
computer:/// - mounted devices and network
file:/// - local files
network:/// - available networks
burn:/// - burning media
smb:/// - windows/samba networks
x-nautilus-desktop:/// - desktop objects and icons
trash:/// - local trash
```
