<p>To find files and execute a command on the files found, do the following:</p>

<code>cd /path/to/directory
find ./ ! -iname "*.mp3" -type f -exec echo {} \;</code>

<p>The above command finds any non-mp3 (! -iname *.mp3) file (-type f) in the current directory (./) and prints the file found (-exec echo {}). The curly brackets are replaced with the found files. "\;" signals the end of the command to execute.</p>

<p>The tests may be chained to together:</p>
<code>find ./ ! -iname "*.mp3" ! -iname "*.m3u" ! -iname "*.pls" -type f -exec echo {} \;</code>

<p>To remove or perform another action on the files found, change the exec action. The following will remove the files found:</p>
<code>find ./ ! -iname "*.mp3" ! -iname "*.m3u" ! -iname "*.pls" -type f -exec rm {} \;</code>
