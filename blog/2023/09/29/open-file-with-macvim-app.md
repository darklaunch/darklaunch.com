# Open file with MacVim.app

Find the MacVim.app application under the `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX` which can be `/opt/homebrew`.

Confirm the `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX` path by running the following command:

```
$ echo $HOMEBREW_PREFIX
```

```
/opt/homebrew
```

In this case, MacVim is installed at `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/macvim/` so find the `MacVim.app` under that folder instead of the usual `/Applications` folder.

For example, this particular version of MacVim can be found under `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/macvim/9.0.1276/MacVim.app`
