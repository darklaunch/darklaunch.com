<p>The most compatible way to add a favicon is to use a self-closing link element with the rel property containing the words "shortcut" and "icon".</p>

<code name="html">
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="path/to/favicon.ico" />
</code>

<p>The word "shortcut" is a workaround for Internet Explorer if you have an icon that is not named "favicon.ico" or to share the favicon for subdomains.</p>

<p>Lastly, you can omit specifying the favicon at the top of the page as long as your icon is named "favicon.ico" and is available at the root direction; e. g.: http://www.example.com/favicon.ico ...but using this method is not recommended as the page will load before the icon is displayed.</p>
