To find a file by the filename, do the following:
```
find . -name "filename*"
```

Do a case-insensitive search using -iname:
```
find . -iname "filename*"
```

The asterisk ("*") may be used as a wildcard.

                <p>Thanks for the command.  Perhaps I messid a step but if you are searching multiple archives how can you tell which one contains the file.Also if I'm looking for a file named  config  it will match all files containing the work config.Not sure how to go about solving these issues.  Let me know if you have any thoughts on solutions.</p>
