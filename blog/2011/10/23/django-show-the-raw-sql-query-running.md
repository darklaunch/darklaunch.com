<p>To see the raw SQL queries Django is running, do the following:</p>

<p>In your settings file (typically settings.py), ensure DEBUG is set to True</p>
<code name="py">
DEBUG = True
</code>

<p>Then import connection from django.db and print connection.queries</p>
<code name="py">
import pprint

from django.db import connection


pprint.pprint(connection.queries)
</code>

<p>If your queries are slowing you down, look into using select_related() to follow foreign keys</p>
