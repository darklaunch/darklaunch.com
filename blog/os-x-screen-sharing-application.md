Use the OS X Screen Sharing Application similar to Windows Remote Desktop Connection.
```/System/Library/CoreServices/Screen Sharing.app
```
```
$ open "/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Screen Sharing.app"
$ open "/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Screen Sharing.app" vnc://hostname
```
```
For older systems use:
$ open "/System/Library/CoreServices/Screen Sharing.app"
$ open "/System/Library/CoreServices/Screen Sharing.app" vnc://hostname
```
