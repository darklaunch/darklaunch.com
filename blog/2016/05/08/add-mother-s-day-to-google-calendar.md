# Add Mother's day to Google calendar

Create calendar event for Mother's Day celebrated on the 2nd Sunday of May.

1. Create a new ics (iCalendar) file like `mothersday.ics`:

```
BEGIN:VCALENDAR
BEGIN:VEVENT
RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;INTERVAL=1;BYMONTH=5;BYDAY=2SU
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20160508
SUMMARY:Mother's Day
END:VEVENT
END:VCALENDAR
```

2. Import the file into Google Calendar:

Select options for your calendar.

<img alt="" src="/img/uploads/2016-05/calendar-options.png" />

Select the "Settings and sharing" option.

<img alt="" src="/img/uploads/2016-05/calendar-settings-and-sharing.png" />

Select the ics file you created and click the import button.

<img alt="" src="/img/uploads/2016-05/calendar-import-and-export.png" />

Or you can use Apple Calendar.

<img alt="" src="/img/uploads/2016-05/mothers-day-calendar-event.png" />

Your repeating event for Mother's Day will now appear on your calendar.
