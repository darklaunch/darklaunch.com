<p>To set up SSH access to a VirtualBox VM, you need to forward the appropriate ports.</p>

<p>Open Virtual Box preferences, select the Network tab, select Adapter 1, and click on the "Port Forwarding" button. Add a new rule. Host IP and Guest IP are optional and should be blank. Set Host Port to 2222 and Guest Port to 22.</p>

<p>Note: These Port Forwarding settings take effect immediately in VirtualBox 4, so no need to restart.</p>

<p>Note: Listening on ports 0-1023 requires root permissions, so use a Host Port 1024 and higher. In this case we are using 2222 ("22" + "22").</p>

<p>Connect to the virtual machine via SSH with:</p>

<code>ssh -l myusername -p 2222 localhost</code>

<p>Additionally, to transfer files to the virtual machine guest, use the following scp command:</p>

<code>scp -P 2222 /path/to/source/file.txt myusername@localhost:/path/to/destination/</code>
