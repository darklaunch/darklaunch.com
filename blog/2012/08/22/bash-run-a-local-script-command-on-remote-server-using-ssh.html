<p>Use ssh to run a local bash script on a remote computer.</p>

<p>Use the following syntax:</p>
<code>
ssh user@host sh < myscript.sh
ssh user@host bash < myscript.sh
</code>

<p>If using bash, include "#!/bin/bash" at the top of myscript.sh and be sure to call `bash' instead of `sh' or you may get commands not found.</p>
