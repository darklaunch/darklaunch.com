<p>To run a script or set of commands from a remote website, do the following:</p>

<code>
bash < <(curl --silent https://www.example.com/path/to/script.sh)
</code>

<p>This will cause curl to pull the script and redirect its contents to stdin for bash to parse.</p>

<p>NOTE: be careful with this</p>
