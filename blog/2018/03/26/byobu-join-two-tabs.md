<p>Join two tabs (also called panes) in Byobu by calling running a tmux command.</p>

<p>Call the Byobu tmux prefix (Ctrl + a) followed by a colon.</p>

<code name="bash">
Ctrl + a + :
</code>

<p>At the prompt, run the join-pane command with the source panel using the -s flag.</p>

<code name="bash">
:join-pane -s 2
</code>

<p>This will split the current window horizontally with the current window in the top and the window in position 2 in the bottom.</p>

<code>
     join-pane [-bdhv] [-l size | -p percentage] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
                   (alias: joinp)
             Like split-window, but instead of splitting dst-pane and creating a new pane, split it and move
             src-pane into the space.  This can be used to reverse break-pane.  The -b option causes src-pane
             to be joined to left of or above dst-pane.
