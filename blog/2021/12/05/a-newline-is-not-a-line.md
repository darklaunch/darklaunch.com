# A newline is not a line

"Files should end with newlines." True -- files should end with newline characters. However, sometimes this is incorrectly interpreted to mean that files should end with an extra line.

A newline is not a line -- it is a character (Line Feed `LF`) and sometimes 2 characters (`CRLF`, Carriage Return + Line Feed).

Files should end with a newline character and not extra lines.

The character should be a Line Feed character (`LF`, `0x0A`, `\n`).
